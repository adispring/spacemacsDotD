* Hooks

Most major modes run one or more mode hooks as the last step of initialization. 
Mode hooks are a convenient way to customize the behavior of individual modes; 
they are always normal. For example, here's how to set up a hook to turn on
Auto Fill mode in Text mode and other modes based on Text mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
#+END_SRC
